    <h2>Sweet And Savory Pork That Will Leave You Wanting More!</h2>
    <p>This Vietnamese Pork recipe is an epic Vietnamese food speciality that’s easy to recreate in your own home. Slow cooked tender pork pieces in a sticky savoury-sweet glaze, Vietnamese Caramel Pork is a magical way to transform pork shoulder into something exotic and spectacular. And it’s SO easy!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp water</li>
        <li>2 lb pork shoulder</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cup (375 ml) coconut water</li>
        <li>1 shallot</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tbsp fish sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp white pepper</li>
        <li>Red chilli and finely sliced green onion for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place sugar and water in a large pot over medium heat. Stir, then when it bubbles and the sugar is melted (it looks like caramel), add the rest of the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Stir, then adjust the heat so it is simmering fairly energetically. Not rapidly, not a slow simmer (I use medium heat on a weak stove, between medium and low on a strong stove).</li>
        <li>Simmer for 1.5 hours, uncovered. Stir once or twice while cooking.</li>
        <li>At around 1.5 hours, when the liquid has reduced down and the pork is tender, (see Note 3 if pork is not yet tender), the fat will separate.</li>
        <li>Stir and the pork will brown and caramelise in the fat.</li>
        <li>Once the liquid is all gone and it's now stuck on the pork pieces, it's ready.</li>
        <li>Serve over rice, garnished with fresh chilli and shallots. Simple pickled vegetables are ideal for a side because the fresh acidity pairs well with the rich pork.</li>
    </ol>
